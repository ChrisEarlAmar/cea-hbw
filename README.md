# CEA-HBW - Hotel Booking Website

CEA-HBW is a hotel booking website developed using PHP and MySQL. This project is currently ongoing and intended for learning purposes. Please note that it is not yet fully finished. This website is a simulated web-based hotel booking environment, and it assumes that the user has already executed their payment during the booking process.

## Current Features

1. **Customer UI**: This includes user interface pages for customers. The backend functionality is limited to managing the site's title, description, carousel images, facilities, and team member swiper.

2. **Admin UI**: An admin user interface is available, along with backend functionality. Note that the admin dashboard is not yet implemented.

## Upcoming Features

I plan to deliver the following features in future updates:

1. **User Registration and Login (Customer)**: Allow customers to register and log in to their accounts.

2. **Booking, Reservation, and Refund Management**: Implement functionality to manage hotel bookings, reservations, and refund requests.

3. **Profile and Reviews**: Enable users to manage their profiles and leave reviews for hotels.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Update `db_config.php` and `db_connection.php` (both located in `/admin/inc/`) with your database credentials.

2. Import the SQL file to create the necessary database structure.

## Admin Credentials

To access the admin panel, use the following credentials:

- **Username**: admin1
- **Password**: 12345

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project as it continues to develop!
