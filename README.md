# CEA-HBW - Hotel Booking Website

CEA-HBW is a hotel booking website developed using PHP and MySQL. This project is currently ongoing and intended only for learning purposes. Please note that it is not yet fully finished. This website is a simulated web-based hotel booking environment, and it assumes that the user has already executed their payment during the booking process. This project does not integrate to any APIs for payment methods.

## Current Features

1. **Customer UI**: This includes user interface pages for customers. The backend functionality is limited to fetching from the database and displaying the site's title, description, carousel images, facilities, and team member swiper.

2. **Admin UI**: An admin user interface is available, along with backend functionality. Note that the admin dashboard is not yet implemented.

## Upcoming Features

I plan to deliver the following features in future updates:

1. **User Registration and Login (Customer)**: Allow customers to register and log in to their accounts.

2. **Booking, Reservation, and Refund Management**: Implement functionality to manage hotel bookings, reservations, and refund requests.

3. **Profile and Reviews**: Enable users to manage their profiles and leave reviews for hotels.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Update `db_config.php` and `db_connection.php` (both located in `/admin/inc/`) with your database credentials.

2. Import the SQL file to create the necessary database structure.

## Admin Credentials

To access the admin panel, go to cea-hbw/admin and use the following credentials:

- **Username**: admin1
- **Password**: 12345

Feel free to explore this project as it continues to develop!
